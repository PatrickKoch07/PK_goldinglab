General overview:
This should run very similarly to the currently widely used post spot recognition code used in the lab. The use for this code is just to group all of the individual data files from each image and to group them into a single data structure with cluster information. Additionally, it will make another data set on a whole cell level, similar to the spatzcell workflow. There are some figures that can be made, but to use this code for figure making is up to the user.

How to run the code:
As a reminder, to run this code all that should be needed (after running cluster recognition) is to change files names and directories.

What to expect as outputs:
Here we see the cluster information output:
